# pivotIrrigationSystem
This project optimizes pivot irrigation distribution on a 145.88ha farm (Explotación Agraria Puertas SL) to minimize total cost (pivots + sprinkler) and maximize coverage within irregular boundaries.  It used an MINLP model (AMPL/Gurobi) with geometric constraints (no overlap, 800m max radius). Result: The current 3-pivot layout is optimal.
